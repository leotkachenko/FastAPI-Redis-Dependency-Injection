# FastAPI + Redis + Dependency Injection Template

This project template provides a starting point for building advanced web applications using FastAPI, Redis, and Dependency Injection in Python.

## Features

- Utilizes FastAPI, a modern web framework for building high-performance APIs.
- Integrates Redis, an in-memory data store, for efficient caching or database operations.
- Implements Dependency Injection to manage and organize dependencies effectively.
